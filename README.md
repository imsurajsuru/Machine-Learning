**Files:**
Telco_Customer_Churn.csv: Dataset containing customer information and churn status.
Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction-Supervised-Learning-End-To-End.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for exploring data, building and evaluating machine learning models.
churn_app.py: Python script building a web application for interactive churn prediction.
churn_main.py: Python script for running the trained model and making predictions.
random_forest_model.joblib: Saved Random Forest model file for prediction.

**Setup:**
Install required libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, Flask (if using the web app).
Download and save the project files.

**Usage:**
Model Exploration and Development: Open Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction-Supervised-Learning-End-To-End.ipynb in a Jupyter Notebook environment. Follow the steps and experiment with different models.
Make Predictions: Run churn_main.py with your desired input data for churn prediction.
Web App (Optional): Run churn_app.py to launch a web app where you can enter customer data and view predicted churn probability.
